# Oasis Terms of Use


  These Terms of Use are here to make sure everyone has a great time and stays safe. Ready? Letâ€™s roll!

**1. Respect Each Other** and ***NO sharing with authorities***  
Oasis is all about community. Be kind, respectful, and considerate. Harassment, hate speech, and bullying are big no-nos. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

**2. Keep It Legal**  
Donâ€™t use Oasis for anything illegal. This includes promoting illegal activities, or anything else that breaks the law. Letâ€™s keep it clean, folks!

**3. Privacy Matters**  
 ***What happens in Oasis, stays in Oasis***.

**4. Instant Ban**  
Keep the spam and unsolicited self-promotion out of here. Weâ€™re all for sharing cool stuff, but letâ€™s not flood the feed with ads or irrelevant content. Any kind of self-promotion and advertisement will lead to getting banned.

**5. NSFW Content**  
If youâ€™re part of the NSFW community, keep it there. Donâ€™t post NSFW content in the public areas. And remember, respect the boundaries and privacy of that community.

**6. Updates and Changes**  
We might update these Terms of Use from time to time. When we do, weâ€™ll let you know. By continuing to use Oasis, youâ€™re agreeing to the new terms.
