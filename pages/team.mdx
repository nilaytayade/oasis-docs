# The Team

The Oasis team has poured their hearts and souls into this project over the past several months. We've spent countless late nights brainstorming, coding, and refining to create a platform that feels like home for our college community. Our dedication to building a safe, fun, and inclusive space is reflected in every feature we've designed. This journey has been a labor of love, driven by our passion to enhance your college experience. We’re incredibly proud of what we've built, and we can’t wait for you to dive in and join us. Thank you for being part of our Oasis family. 🌴✨
