# The Team

The Oasis team has poured their hearts and souls into this project over the past several months. We've spent countless late nights brainstorming, coding, and refining to create a platform that feels like home for our college community. Our dedication to building a safe, fun, and inclusive space is reflected in every feature we've designed. This journey has been a labor of love, driven by our passion to enhance your college experience. Weâ€™re incredibly proud of what we've built, and we canâ€™t wait for you to dive in and join us. Thank you for being part of our Oasis family. ðŸŒ´âœ¨
